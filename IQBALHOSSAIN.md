# Interactive Storytelling Platform with Branching Narratives.
### Utilized:  HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL
# STEPS:
1. At first install XAMPP to run this project
2. ### Database name must be storytelling
3. ### Import the database SQL file which exists in the "DB_SQL" folder

```diff
- It supports one story only!

```
# Future Development
1. Support multiple stories.
2. Readers interact with their stories, such as which options are most popular, and a nice-to-have feature that tracks how long users spend on each section.

# Descriptions:
<h3>This platform is developed so that we can read and create interactive stories.</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create Story Section
      <ul style="list-style-typeðŸ”´">
        <li>Users can write interactive story </li>
        <li>Writers can set multiple paths which direct the story</li>
        <li>At the end of each path writer set the result of this path</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  <li>Read Story Section
     <ul style="list-style-typeðŸ”´">
        <li> Users can read already-written stories. </li>
       <li>When a user opens a story to read it, readers are allowed to interact with the story and shape its outcome.</li>
       <li>>Rather than being limited to a linear narrative, readers can choose from a variety of options to determine where the story will go. This means that every reader can have a unique experience and create their own story. It also means that readers can go back and explore different paths and endings.</li>
     </ul>
  
  </li>
  <li> Popularity Tracking Section 
      <ul style="list-style-typeðŸ”´">
      <li>Store user's interaction of each story and its path </li>
        <li>This section helps readers to identify the favorite story and also helps to find out the most popular decision path which is clicked more times</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
